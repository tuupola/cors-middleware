    $app->add(new \Tuupola\Middleware\CorsMiddleware([
        "methods" => ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "PATCH", "DELETE"],
    ]));
    ```
    ```php
    $app->add(new \Tuupola\Middleware\CorsMiddleware([
        "methods" => function(ServerRequestInterface $request) {
            /* Some logic to figure out allowed $methods. */
